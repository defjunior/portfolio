# About Me
* I am an artist
* I really enjoy programming and math
### Beginning
* Beginning from 7 years old, I was basically always behind a computer, and so I became really good at using it and I would often help my parents out with technology issues
* I taught myself how to make games on Roblox by reading the documentation 
* I rewrote the entire system of **Squad Delta** to be object-oriented and this allowed me to try and make an AI which would be able to play the game, to fill lobbies before the game has enough players
    * I researched ways to approach making AI for games and realized that it wasn't too difficult to turn human approaches to games into code
    * I developed a behavior tree approach and a general outline which became the basis for my AI in other games
* I revisted making a fighting game with **Astera**, a successor to the earlier **Rift** project with object oriented code
* I created a table-tennis game called **Rally** which is similar to the game from Wii Play
* I made **Connect4** and **Tic-Tac-Toe** as quick commissions for someone else, I could probably make anything given a detailed explanation.
*  I became proficient in **Blender** to make 3D models for the equipment used in games
* I developed better approaches to AI in games and applied those techniques to the **NPCs** in **Astera**
    * Developing the AI here made me realize the fundamental importance of mathematics in programming, and made me decide to commit myself to learning and appreciating it 
* Currently, I'm focused on finishing the last touches on **Squad Delta**, and making a demo for **Astera**.
