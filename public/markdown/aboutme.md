* I am an artist
* I really enjoy programming and math
### Beginning
* Beginning from 7 years old, I was basically always behind a computer, and so I became really good at using it and I would often help my parents out with technology issues
* I taught myself how to make games at an early age, I was introduced to Scratch in elementary school and wanted to figure out Roblox soon after
* I taught myself how to make games on Roblox by reading the documentation and watching Youtube videos
### Middle School
* Since elementary school, I hadn't done much work but instead focused on drawing
* During the 2020 pandemic, I decided to go back to developing and focused on making an FPS game called **Squad Delta** on Roblox
* I learned the majority of my fundamentals trying to make this game, including **object oriented programming**, how to design systems, and basic skills in image editing, **3D modelling software**, and began experimenting with other things
* I began a side project whenever I was exhausted from working, called **Rift**, a class-based fighting game
    * It didn't get very far, but gave me better insight into modular code and systems design
### High School
* Since Middle school, I began taking my work more seriously, rewriting a majority of the code written for **Squad Delta**, and venturing into making other games
* I rewrote the entire system of **Squad Delta** to be object-oriented and this allowed me to try and make an AI which would be able to play the game, to fill lobbies before the game has enough players
    * I researched ways to approach making AI for games and realized that it wasn't too difficult to turn human approaches to games into code
    * I developed a behavior tree approach and a general outline which became the basis for my AI in other games
* I revisted making a fighting game with **Astera**, a successor to the earlier **Rift** project with object oriented code
* I created a table-tennis game called **Rally** which is similar to the game from Wii Play
* I made **Connect4** and **Tic-Tac-Toe** as quick commissions for someone else
*  I became proficient in **Blender** to make 3D models for the equipment used in games
* I developed better approaches to AI in games and applied those techniques to the **NPCs** in **Astera**
    * Developing the AI here made me realize the fundamental importance of mathematics in programming, and made me decide to commit myself to learning and appreciating it 
* Currently, I'm focused on finishing the last touches on **Squad Delta**, and making a demo for **Astera**.
